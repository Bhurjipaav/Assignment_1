2nd week's Web Dev Assignment 
Assignment for this week
For this week, your task is to create the basic landing page for the inventory portal. It must include:
*A top navbar having tabs like music inventory, sports inventory, tech inventory, and a tab for the contact us page.
*A testimonial div for showing the top reviews on the landing page itself.
*An input box that takes in the user input about the name, email address, room number, etc. to subscribe to the newsletter would inform the users about the new equipment being added to the inventory.
Any added functionality would be considered a bonus! So put your creative minds to work and all the best for the assignment!

I've created the portal having all the above aspects.
